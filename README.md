# NextGen Stats

This project is a web application that I built with JavaScript, React, and
Next.js that allows users to view player stats for Overwatch 2 (and more coming
soon).

## Features

- User authentication leveraging MongoDB as a database solution
- Search for player stats by battletag
- Save favorite battletags for easy access
- View detailed player stats, including win rates!

## Usage

To use this app, visit the Vercel Distribution. Alternatively, you may clone the
repository locally, open the folder with VSCode and run "npm run dev". Then,
visit localhost:3000 on your computer to see a local instance of the app!

## Vercel Distribution

An online version of the app is available at:
<https://nextgen-capstone.vercel.app/>

## Using the app

To use the application, you'll want to register for an account. Once you're
logged in, you can search for player stats by entering a BattleTag into the
search bar. You can also save your favorite BattleTags for easy access later.
